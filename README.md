# xk6-encoding

This is a [k6](https://go.k6.io/k6) extension using the [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) system.

| :exclamation: This is a proof of concept, isn't supported by the k6 team, and may break in the future. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! |

This a try at fixing some of the problems with the internal k6 encoding package
